## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for developers looking to leverage LLMs (specifically Cascade) in their software development process. The approach outlined here emphasizes thoughtful planning, systematic development, and efficient interaction with AI assistants.

## Getting Started

Before diving into development, it's crucial to:
1. Clearly define your application concept
2. Map out core functionality
3. Plan the user experience (UX)
4. List and prioritize key features

These elements form the foundation of your project and will guide your interaction with Cascade.

## Key Documents

- [In-Depth Cascade Prompting Guide](cascade-prompting-guide.md) - Learn how to structure and optimize your prompts for Cascade
- [LLM Prompt Templates for Rapid Prototyping](llm-prompt-templates-for-rapid-prototyping.md) - Ready-to-use templates for common development scenarios (to be completed by the LLM)

## Workflow Overview

My recommended workflow follows these principles:

1. **Component-Based Development**
   - Break down your project into distinct components
   - Develop one component at a time
   - Start fresh conversations with Cascade for each component

2. **Documentation-First Approach**
   - Create detailed specifications before coding
   - Use the Cascade prompt template to create component-specific promptfiles
   - Maintain changelogs for each development session

3. **Iterative Development**
   - Build incrementally
   - Test each component thoroughly
   - Include previous documentation in new development sessions

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Specification**
   - Take time to clearly define your application requirements
   - Create detailed user stories and feature lists
   - Document expected behaviors and edge cases

2. **Structured Development**
   - Use the provided prompt templates for consistency
   - Break large tasks into manageable components
   - Start new chat sessions for each major component

3. **Documentation Management**
   - Keep changelogs updated
   - Include relevant documentation in new chat sessions
   - Maintain clear links between related components

By following this guide and utilizing the provided templates, you'll be able to effectively leverage Cascade for your software development needs while maintaining code quality and project organization.
